## Recreational Boating Accidents
### Dataset: 
- Provided by U.S. Coast Guard; Access Database file for years 2017 and 2018; multiple tables; all states except California
- Queried, normalized and exported to csv
- 11,865 observations; 36 features
- Cleaned, wrangled and organized data in R and Python; approximately 1000 lines of code 

### Hypothesis: 
Expected to see that most accidents occur due to a lack of operator experience, heavy traffic, poor weather or light conditions, or the use of alcohol. I hoped to validate this thesis and learn the extent to which boater attention to waterway conditions can reduce accidents from happening.  

### Audience: 
All boaters or people that are enjoy U.S. waterways.  One impact that COVID-19 had on the 2020 boating season is that demand is at an all time high for boats.  Boat brokers across the country are reporting record numbers, and some manufacturers are struggling to keep up.  This means there is a surge in new boaters which means the water has become more dangerous with an increase of inexperienced boaters.

### Research Questions:
What are the boating accident outcomes and how many are there?
What happened?                     
What was the cause?
