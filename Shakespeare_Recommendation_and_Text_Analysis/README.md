## Shakespeare
William Shakespeare is considered one of the greatest playwrights in the English language. He is attributed with 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and other works. Even 400 years later, his writings are still be studied in most high schools and colleges in the US and elsewhere. Shakespeareâ€™s complete works are available online at http://shakespeare.mit.edu/. We will be using a data set which has Shakespeare character quotes. A lot of people are fascinated by the characters in the Shakespeare plays. The first first part of the assignment is to create a Shakespeare character recommender system which is capable of recommending new characters which are similar to a speicific character of interest. We will also explore using PCA inference to find important words in character quotes. In the second part of the assignment we will use K-Means clustering to try and find one or more character insights.
