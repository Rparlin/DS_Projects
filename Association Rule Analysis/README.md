## Association Rule Mining

The purpose of this analysis is to offer actionable insight based on customer profile models that better predict which customers are more likely or less likely to purchase Personal Equity Plans or similar type products. This project analyzes a “bankdata” dataset provided by our client.  The dataset contains features on customer demographics, banking information, as well as whether or not the customer purchased a Personal Equity Plan (PEP) after the financial firm sent out a promotional direct mail piece advertising a call to action to purchase a PEP.     

The analysis was conducted using Association Rule Mining using the Apriori algorithm conducted in a WEKA software suite.
