# Applied Data Science Capstone Portfolio
## Hello! This repo includes a collection of material (scripts, reports, graphics, etc.) that showcase a portion of my recent work. Each section below provides a little detail about the artifacts in the repo.  Below are a sample of tools and techniques I've been using with my work over the last few years.  This is very much a rough draft and will be updated over the next few months.

## Recreational Boating Accidents
### Dataset: 
- Provided by U.S. Coast Guard; Access Database file for years 2017 and 2018; multiple tables; all states except California
- Queried, normalized and exported to csv
- 11,865 observations; 36 features
- Cleaned, wrangled and organized data in R and Python; approximately 1000 lines of code 

### Hypothesis: 
Expected to see that most accidents occur due to a lack of operator experience, heavy traffic, poor weather or light conditions, or the use of alcohol. I hoped to validate this thesis and learn the extent to which boater attention to waterway conditions can reduce accidents from happening.  

### Audience: 
All boaters or people that are enjoy U.S. waterways.  One impact that COVID-19 had on the 2020 boating season is that demand is at an all time high for boats.  Boat brokers across the country are reporting record numbers, and some manufacturers are struggling to keep up.  This means there is a surge in new boaters which means the water has become more dangerous with an increase of inexperienced boaters.

### Research Questions:
What are the boating accident outcomes and how many are there?
What happened?                     
What was the cause?

## U.S. Army Recruiting: Applications for Data Analytics and Machine Learning
There has been much discussion on Army recruiting for decades, but today’s data-rich environment offers new ways the Army can leverage and deployed data-driven outreach and recruiting strategies.

- Can the Army better recruit those that are more likely to make the Army a career and thereby reduce the demand for new recruits?  
- How can the Army better understand the defining characteristics of their target market and better communicate the Army’s value proposition to these candidates?  
- How can the Army better connect with the critical influencers that help young men and women make the decision to join?  
- What makes some recruiters more successful than others?
Can the Army model its current successful Soldiers that have decided to serve beyond their first enlistment and see what data patterns emerge and use this insight to inform future selection of candidates.  

This paper explores several machine learning and data mining techniques that could be useful in finding answers to questions like these and facilitate Army marketing efforts.

## Rapid Analysis Report
This project was inspired by a real job interview from a data analysis company.  Each student was provided a small dataset and given 30 minute to analyze and report through brief visual storytelling.  

Each of 5 schools (A, B, C, D and E) is implementing the same math course this semester, with 35 lessons. There are 30 sections total. The semester is about 3/4 of the way through.  Our task was to rapidly report what we saw in the data.

## Association Rule Mining
The purpose of this analysis is to offer actionable insight based on customer profile models that better predict which customers are more likely or less likely to purchase Personal Equity Plans or similar type products. This project analyzes a “bankdata” dataset provided by our client. The dataset contains features on customer demographics, banking information, as well as whether or not the customer purchased a Personal Equity Plan (PEP) after the financial firm sent out a promotional direct mail piece advertising a call to action to purchase a PEP.

The analysis was conducted using Association Rule Mining using the Apriori algorithm conducted in a WEKA software suite.

## Online Learning Outcomes: Impacts of Demographic, Socioeconomic, and Student Behavior

The world is currently undergoing the largest online learning academic endeavor ever recorded. Around the globe, students and teachers from kindergarten through college, with little warning, have migrated their classrooms from physical to virtual environments. The shear timeline and volume of this shift is astonishing. However, will this new-normal compromise the quality of education? This analysis uses Linear Statistical Methods to dsicover what impacts student and learning platform charateristics have on learning outcomes.

## Shakespeare Anyone?
Many believe William Shakespeare is considered one of the greatest playwrights in the English language. He is attributed with 38 plays, 154 sonnets, and other works. Even 400 years later, his writings are still be studied in most high schools and colleges in the US and elsewhere. Shakespeare’s complete works are available online at http://shakespeare.mit.edu/. This analysis uses a data set which has Shakespeare character quotes. A lot of people are fascinated by the characters in the Shakespeare plays. The first first part of the analysis creates a Shakespeare character recommender system which is capable of recommending new characters which are similar to a speicific character of interest. This analysis also explores using PCA inference to find important words in character quotes. Lastly, this analysis uses K-Means clustering to try and find one or more character insights. This analysis was conducted using Spark and Python.

## Inference on Diamonds!

These are two Jupyter Notebooks that use Apache Spark (and Python) to conduct distributed processing. The data files are not large, but they efficiently allow the demonstration of how distributed processing works.

If you don't have Spark (Java/Hadoop) installed on your computer, simply download the Notebook and data file to your local directory and explore the using DataBricks (https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html) or a crowd favorite, Google Colab (https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html)

## Data_Parlin_Final_Portfolio
This is an older product that I built while doing research on my Capstone Thesis at Georgetown.  It explores a collection of data on the sharing-economy and is designed to inform policy position.
