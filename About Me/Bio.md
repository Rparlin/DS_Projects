## Bio

### " I’ve experienced first-hand how having correct information at the right time can be the difference between saving and costing lives.  Getting this right is my purpose."

Working as a lobster fisherman in Maine after high school, Ralph Parlin’s desire to be part of something bigger than himself drew him to enlist in the U.S. Army.  Immediately captivated by the camaraderie, nobility, and love for his fellow Soldiers and country, Ralph committed to a life of service.  Inspired by encouragement from leaders, coupled with a desire to have greater impact, Ralph dedicated himself to becoming an officer and began full-time college study and ROTC.
Commissioned as an Infantry Lieutenant, Ralph immersed himself in Infantry, airborne, and Ranger school before deploying to Iraq in support of the “surge” in 2007, and again in 2009. In Afghanistan as an Infantry Company Commander, Ralph was inspired by the incredible impact the ubiquitous proliferation of technology was having on the battlefield.  Following deployment, Ralph was selected for an Army Fellowship program, where he earned a Master’s in Policy at Georgetown University. Ralph later served as a Military Fellow for Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and later Jim Mattis.
Ralph’s academic and professional experience showed him the transformative power of data compelling him to want to lead change and improve the Defense Department’s ability to better integrate data technology into enterprise process and warfighting domains.  To best effect this change required a professional pivot leading Ralph to apply and be selected as an Operations Research Systems Analyst (ORSA).  Now, Ralph is pursuing his Master’s in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, helping the Defense Department leverage the transformative power of data.

## Special Skills and Expertise
Professionally, I’m an Operations Research Systems Analyst for the U.S. Army, specializing in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science policy.  I am committed to developing teams across organizations and continually learning from others. I believe the moment a person stops learning is the same moment they become an ineffective leader. I have worked from the tactical to strategic levels of the Defense Department, and guided by my entrepreneurial spirit, I have built a reputation as a servant leader capable of distilling complex problems into easily understood concepts that lead to executable solutions.
Personally, I’m a husband and a father of two wonderful and time-consuming kids. As a boy in Maine I was a lobster fisherman so I have always had a love for the water.  Now, my family shares that love so when afforded the opportunity, we spend as much time on our small boat as possible.  We have cruised all through the Puget Sound, and more recently the Chesapeake Bay.  We are an active family that loves to cuddle and loves life.
