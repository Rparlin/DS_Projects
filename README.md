# DS_Projects
## A collection of Data Science Projects available to the public.  

Included in this repo are a collection of material (scripts, reports, graphics, etc.) that showcase a portion of my recent work. Each section below provides a little detail about the material in the repo.

## Recreational Boating Accidents
### Dataset: 
- Provided by U.S. Coast Guard; Access Database file for years 2017 and 2018; multiple tables; all states except California
- Queried, normalized and exported to csv
- 11,865 observations; 36 features
- Cleaned, wrangled and organized data in R and Python; approximately 1000 lines of code 

### Hypothesis: 
Expected to see that most accidents occur due to a lack of operator experience, heavy traffic, poor weather or light conditions, or the use of alcohol. I hoped to validate this thesis and learn the extent to which boater attention to waterway conditions can reduce accidents from happening.  

### Audience: 
All boaters or people that are enjoy U.S. waterways.  One impact that COVID-19 had on the 2020 boating season is that demand is at an all time high for boats.  Boat brokers across the country are reporting record numbers, and some manufacturers are struggling to keep up.  This means there is a surge in new boaters which means the water has become more dangerous with an increase of inexperienced boaters.

### Research Questions:
What are the boating accident outcomes and how many are there?
What happened?                     
What was the cause?


## U.S. Army Recruiting: Applications for Data Analytics and Machine Learning
There has been much discussion on Army recruiting for decades, but today’s data-rich environment offers new ways the Army can leverage and deployed data-driven outreach and recruiting strategies.

- Can the Army better recruit those that are more likely to make the Army a career and thereby reduce the demand for new recruits?  
- How can the Army better understand the defining characteristics of their target market and better communicate the Army’s value proposition to these candidates?  
- How can the Army better connect with the critical influencers that help young men and women make the decision to join?  
- What makes some recruiters more successful than others?
For example, the Army can model its current successful Soldiers that have decided to serve beyond their first enlistment and see what data patterns emerge and use this insight to inform future selection of candidates.  

This paper explores several machine learning and data mining techniques that could be useful in finding answers to questions like these and facilitate Army marketing efforts.
